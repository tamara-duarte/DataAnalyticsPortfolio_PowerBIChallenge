# Overview:
The dashboard above was one of the three best dashboards in the “Power BI Challenge” promoted by the “Women in Data” (Mulheres em Dados) Brazilian women community in September of 2022.

The challenge was a simulation of a data analyst routine when receiving a demand from a sales department. 

# Challenge:
Bringing insights to a sales team to support the sales planning and promotions. The database was a spreadsheet with sales raw data to be transformed to generate information on the customer's profile and the best selling products, regions and months.

# The Dashboards:

# Financial Overview:

The first dashboard brings a general financial overview and by product. The client visualizes:

- “Gross Revenue” (= Faturamento Bruto); “Net Revenue” (= Faturamento Líquido) and “Nº of products sold” (= Nº de unidades vendidas) 
- A comparison between gross and net revenue by month (= Faturamento por Mês)
- The gross revenue comparison based in the product's category, segment and category(= Faturamento por Segmento e Categoria)
- The gross revenue comparison based in the client's purchase region (= Faturamento por Região)

Each of them can be visualized by year (selecting "Ano") or  by the product category or region (clicking on the column corresponding to each).
