## 💻 The Dashboards:

### Financial Overview:

The first dashboard brings a general financial overview and by product. The client visualizes:

- “Gross Revenue” (= Faturamento Bruto); “Net Revenue” (= Faturamento Líquido) and “Nº of products sold” (= Nº de unidades vendidas) 
- A comparison between gross and net revenue by month (= Faturamento por Mês)
- The gross revenue comparison based in the product's category, segment and category(= Faturamento por Segmento e Categoria)
- The gross revenue comparison based in the client's purchase region (= Faturamento por Região)

Each of them can be visualized by year (selecting "Ano") or  by the product category or region (clicking on the column corresponding to each).
